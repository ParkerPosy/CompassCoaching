## 🔍 Technical SEO Implementation

### Page Titles
**Format**: `[Benefit/Topic] | Compass Coaching`

**Best Practices**:
- 50-60 characters maximum
- Include primary keyword
- Put most important words first
- Include location (Pennsylvania/PA)
- Brand name at end

**Examples**:
- ✅ `Free Career & Life Guidance for Pennsylvania | Compass Coaching`
- ✅ `Free Career Assessment - Find Your Path | Compass Coaching`
- ✅ `PA Career Resources & Life Guidance | Compass Coaching`
- ❌ `Compass Coaching - A Non-Profit Career Platform` (brand first, no benefit)
- ❌ `Home - Compass Coaching` (generic, no keywords)

### Meta Descriptions
**Format**: Benefit + Feature + Call-to-Action

**Best Practices**:
- 150-160 characters maximum (Google truncates at ~160)
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Address user pain point or desire
- Include specific numbers/facts
- End with call-to-action
- Write for humans first, search engines second

**Formula**:
```
[What user gets] + [How/unique feature] + [Specific benefit] + [CTA]
```

**Examples**:
- ✅ `Free personalized career and life guidance for Pennsylvania. Take our assessment, get matched to tailored resources & find your path forward. 100% free.` (158 chars)
- ✅ `Discover your path with our free assessment. Personalized career & life resources for Pennsylvania residents. 90+ guides, tools & expert insights.` (152 chars)
- ✅ `Navigate your future with confidence. Free assessment matches your values & personality to career resources and life guidance. Serving all of PA.` (149 chars)
- ❌ `We are a donation-funded non-profit organization providing career and life guidance resources with PA salary data.` (No clear benefit, reads like "about us")

### Headers (H1-H6)

**Best Practices**:
- One H1 per page (main page title)
- Include primary keyword in H1
- Use H2-H6 for content hierarchy
- Make headers descriptive and benefit-focused
- Use question format for H2/H3 when appropriate (matches voice search)

**Examples**:
```html
<!-- Homepage -->
<h1>Free Career & Life Guidance for Pennsylvania</h1>
<h2>Discover Your Path with Our Free Assessment</h2>
<h2>90+ Resources Matched to Your Values & Goals</h2>

<!-- Assessment Page -->
<h1>Free Career & Life Assessment</h1>
<h2>How Does the Assessment Work?</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Tell Us About Your Personality</h3>
<h3>Step 2: Share Your Core Values</h3>

<!-- Resources Page -->
<h1>Free Career & Life Resources for Pennsylvania</h1>
<h2>Career Guidance Resources</h2>
<h2>Life Wellbeing Resources</h2>

<!-- Salary Feature Page (Supporting) -->
<h1>Pennsylvania Salary Data - Career Planning Tool</h1>
<h2>How to Use Salary Data for Career Decisions</h2>
<h3>Compare Salaries Across PA Counties</h3>

<!-- Blog/Resource Articles -->
<h1>How to Choose the Right Career Path for You</h1>
<h2>5 Steps to Career Clarity</h2>
<h2>Why Values Matter in Career Decisions</h2>
```

## 📝 Content Writing for SEO

### Service Hierarchy (Critical for Positioning)

**Primary Offering** (Lead with this):
1. Comprehensive career and life assessment
2. Personalized resource matching
3. Holistic guidance (career + life wellbeing)

**Supporting Features** (Mention as benefits, not headlines):
- PA wage data for salary decisions
- 90+ curated resources
- County-specific insights
- Progress tracking

**Correct Positioning**:
- ✅ "Take our free assessment to discover your path. We'll match you to personalized resources including PA wage data, career guides, and life wellbeing tools."
- ❌ "Access Pennsylvania wage data for 810+ careers. [Then mention assessment]"

**User Journey Flow**:
```
1. User takes assessment →
2. Gets personalized results →
3. Directed to relevant resources (which may include wage data) →
4. Takes action on their career/life goals
```

### Copywriting Principles

#### 1. Lead with Assessment & Guidance
- ✅ "Discover your path with our free assessment. Get matched to resources that fit your unique values and goals."
- ✅ "Personalized career and life guidance through our comprehensive assessment"
- ❌ "Access 810+ PA occupation salaries and wage data" (makes us sound like a salary database)

#### 2. Career AND Life (Holistic)
- ✅ "Career success and life wellbeing: we guide you in both"
- ✅ "Beyond job search: find resources for mental health, relationships, and personal growth"
- ❌ "Career guidance with some life resources" (too career-focused)

#### 3. Assessment-Driven Value
- ✅ "Your assessment unlocks personalized recommendations"
- ✅ "Matched to your personality, values, and aptitudes"
- ❌ "Browse our 90+ resources" (generic, not personalized)

#### 4. Emotional Hooks
- Address pain points: confusion, lack of direction, feeling lost
- Tap into desires: clarity, confidence, purpose, balance
- Use power words: discover, personalized, free, guided, clarity, path

#### 5. Specific > Generic
- ✅ "5-step assessment covering personality, values, aptitudes, and goals"
- ✅ "90+ resources matched to your profile"
- ❌ "Comprehensive platform for career help"

#### 5. Trust Indicators
Include throughout content:
- "Real PA Dept. of Labor data (May 2024)"
- "100% free, no credit card required"
- "Donation-funded non-profit"
- "Your data stays local"

#### 6. Punctuation Guidelines
- **Avoid excessive em dashes (—)**: Use sparingly for emphasis. Overuse makes copy feel fragmented and less professional.
- ✅ "Completely free, powered by donations" (comma)
- ✅ "Career success and life wellbeing. We guide you in both." (period for separate thoughts)
- ✅ "Personalized guidance for career and life" (remove the aside entirely)
- ❌ "Completely free—powered by donations—no strings attached" (too many em dashes)
- When tempted to use an em dash, consider: comma, period, colon, or restructuring the sentence

### Content Structure for SEO

#### F-Pattern Reading
Users scan in F-pattern:
```
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  <-- Top line (most important)
XXXXXXXXX
XXX
XXXXXXXXXXXX     <-- Second line
XXXXXX
XX
XXXXXXXXX        <-- Third line
```

**Optimize for this**:
- Put keywords in first 100 words
- Make first sentence compelling
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Use bullet points and lists
- Bold important keywords/phrases

#### Keyword Density
- **Target**: 1-2% keyword density
- **Natural placement**: Keywords should flow naturally
- **Variations**: Use synonyms and related terms
- **Avoid**: Keyword stuffing (looks spammy, hurts rankings)

**Example - Good keyword usage**:
```

- ✅ "Find Your Path Forward"

**Generic CTAs** (Lower conversion):
- ❌ "Get Started"
- ❌ "Click Here"

- ❌ "Continue"

### Above-the-Fold Content
First screenful should include:
1. Clear value proposition
2. Trust indicators (free, 810+ careers, PA-specific)
3. Primary CTA
4. Visual hierarchy (important info larger/bolder)

### Social Proof
- "Helping [X] Pennsylvanians find their path" (when you have data)
